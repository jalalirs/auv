"""One dive, stepped by whoever is running it.

This exists because a dive has two audiences and must not have two
implementations. Run headless, it is stepped as fast as the machine allows and
nobody watches. Run in the client, it is stepped once per rendered frame and
somebody is flying it. If those were two loops they would drift, and the first
time they disagreed would be the first time somebody trusted a batch result that
the interactive run had contradicted.

So the loop lives here and the callers differ only in how often they call it and
what they do between calls.
